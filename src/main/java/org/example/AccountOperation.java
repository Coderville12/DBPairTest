/*
Deadlock Risk:
The code is susceptible to a deadlock scenario where two threads could potentially lock from and to accounts in different orders, leading to a deadlock situation where each thread is waiting for the other to release the lock.

Lack of Error Handling:
There is no error handling mechanism in place. If an exception occurs during the debit or credit operations, the accounts could end up in an inconsistent state.

Inefficient Synchronization:
Synchronizing on the account objects directly can lead to performance issues, especially if there are multiple threads accessing different accounts simultaneously.

Lack of Validation:
The code does not validate if the amount is valid or if the from account has sufficient balance to perform the debit operation.

Lack of Logging:
Absence of logging mechanisms makes it difficult to trace and debug issues that may arise during account transfers.
